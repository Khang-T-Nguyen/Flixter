# Flixter
Unit 1: Flixter
Tuan Khang Nguyen
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).
Project overview: User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.
Moreover, Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
    - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
    - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.
GIF file to make sure the GIF acutally renders and animates when viewing this README.

### Challenges while doing this project: I had an error with the relative layout that could not realize the androidX, and I also got some bugs in the UI because I left the ID of these UI attributions in the relative layout, so I could not make the link between the overview and the title.

### Open-source libraries used
